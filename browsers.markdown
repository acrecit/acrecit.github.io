I personally use Vivaldi, but I've used a few other browsers.
Brave is very nice. 

<div class="buttons-grid">
    <a href="https://brave.com" class="button-link">
        <img src="/assets/buttons/brave.gif" alt="GitHub" class="button-img">
    </a>
</div>

The reason I use Vivaldi is simply because I enjoy the information density aesthetic as well as the tab stacking feature, which is rare in other browsers. 

<div class="buttons-grid">
    <a href="https://vivaldi.com" class="button-link">
        <img src="/assets/buttons/vivaldi.gif" alt="GitHub" class="button-img">
    </a>
</div>

I'll probably switch back to Brave soon, but I'm enjoying Vivaldi for now. 

I also use Tor Browser for privacy when I need it. 

<div class="buttons-grid">
    <a href="https://www.torproject.org" class="button-link">
        <img src="/assets/buttons/tor.gif" alt="GitHub" class="button-img">
    </a>
</div>

One day I plan to create my own browser, but I'm not sure if I'll ever get around to it.
