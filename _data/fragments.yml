  title: Manifest Destiny in the Stars
  content: |
    The stars beckon us, not just as celestial bodies, but as challenges laid bare by a divinely ordained hand. We, as humans, created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27), are entrusted with dominion (Genesis 1:28). This isn't just a fancy title; it's a mission statement.
    Our God-given reason and ingenuity have propelled us to the cusp of interstellar travel. It's only natural that we, the inheritors of Earth, now set our sights on the heavens.
    Out there, amidst the alien constellations, we might encounter lesser beings. Those who haven't been graced with a soul, fashioned in the image of the divine, might greet us with confusion or hostility.
    Here's the truth: we are not conquerors, but shepherds. Shepherds tasked with bringing order and civilization to a chaotic frontier. The lesser beings we encounter may possess rudimentary tools and customs, but they lack the spark of true potential.
    Our duty, as the chosen, is to guide them. Through a benevolent hand, we can uplift them, share our knowledge of agriculture, industry, and perhaps, even the divine word. This isn't subjugation; it's elevation.
    Of course, some may resist. The unenlightened, as with any frontier, might lash out in fear or ignorance. But even they can be brought into the fold through righteous perseverance.
    The stars are not just a new frontier; they are the canvas upon which we paint the future. A future where humanity, bathed in the light of God's favor, ushers in a new era of enlightenment across the cosmos. This is our manifest destiny, our burden and our glory.

  title: The Future of Human Evolution
  content: |
    The state of our society and our species as a whole is in disarray, and the more I reflect on it, the more convinced I become that we need to take our evolution into our own hands.
    We've made incredible advances in science and technology, but when it comes to our own biology, we're still leaving too much up to chance. We have the power now to guide our own genetic destiny, to ensure that future generations are born with the best possible traits and abilities.
    Just imagine a world where we could virtually eliminate genetic diseases, where every child is born healthy and strong. A world where we cultivate intelligence, creativity, and physical prowess. Where we have the tools to overcome so many of the challenges and limitations that have held humanity back for centuries.
    I am aware of the controversial nature of this idea. However, people throw around words like "eugenics" as if it's inherently evil, when, in reality, we already practice a form of eugenics every time someone chooses a mate based on desirable qualities. We're just not being systematic or scientific about it.
    I truly believe that if we approached human genetic engineering empirically and logically, with proper oversight and respect for individual rights, it could be an incredible force for good in the world. We could reduce so much suffering, unlock so much potential.
    We cannot keep blindly stumbling forward, leaving our evolution to chance. It's time to take the reins and steer ourselves toward a brighter future. A future where every human being has the opportunity to be the best version of themselves, unshackled from the genetic constraints of the past.
    Firstly, before we begin physically altering the human genome, we must curate our minds to their greatest possible extent. This will help lay the foundation needed to optimally improve the human race through the methods I outlined earlier. Luckily, many methods used in conventional eugenics can be applied to this task.
    So, how do we apply the core principles of eugenics and genetic enhancement to the realms of intellect, skills and abilities?
    We already do this to some degree through things like selective education systems, competitive job markets, and social hierarchies that reward certain traits and skillsets. We've created a society that selects for intelligence, ambition, creativity, social savvy. The most capable and successful people tend to rise to the top, gaining wealth, status and the ability to propagate their lineages and legacies.
    But what if we took this much further? Really engineered our institutions and incentive structures to intentionally sift out desirable abilities and traits. Imagine if procreation was heavily restricted only to those who meet certain thresholds of intellectual and technical prowess., if we poured resources into aggressively cultivating genius and prodigy from a young age, if we streamlined the ascension of the cognitive elite.
    Over time, through cultural transmission and selection effects, perhaps we could meaningfully shape the distribution of human potential, shifting the bell curves of intelligence and ability to the right. We could create a species better adapted for thriving in an increasingly complex, technologically saturated world. A species capable of solving greater challenges and reaching new heights.
    So much of our species' story has been a struggle against natural limits. Perhaps our next great leap forward requires reshaping the very contours of human potential. Carefully curating minds the way we might modify genomes.

  title: An old essay I submitted to a scholarship application
  content: |
    From a young age, I was obsessed with information. I taught myself to read at the tender age of three, and have always maintained a reading level far exceeding my grade level and that of my peers. As my generation steadily grows more apathetic and, frankly, less intelligent, my own thirst for knowledge and information and my work ethic and drive to understand the world around me has grown tremendously.
    I intend to leverage this intrinsic trait to change the world. I do not want to be tied down and trapped into a simple 9-5; another simplistic wage slave and consumer drone, privy to the every whim of any large corporation or powerful individual. I plan to become the best version of myself that could possibly exist, and, in the process, hopefully become something entirely new to the human race as a whole. What I intend to accomplish is explained and outlined below.
    I believe humanity is on the precipice of a new age; a golden age, but not of material things as in eras past, rather; a golden age of information. The ubiquity of the internet and its ever-increasing reach will lead to a relationship with raw information humans have never existed in before. One possibility is that, through political corruption, suppression of free speech, and pushing of agendas in media, an Orwellian dystopia will result, where, although humanity will be closely connected to information at all times, what we learn and consume will be carefully monitored and curated in order to sate the ends of the corrupt elites in power.
    However, this nightmarish hellscape might not be our future. If we strive for accessibility of information in tandem with privacy of the individual as well as constantly furthering human-information interfacing with the overall goal of the flourishing of the human race, we can progress toward a knowledge-driven society. This type of society differs from those in the past because past civilizations were almost universally driven by incentives and markets for material items and wants. I argue that it is time for humanity to overcome this outdated and backwards system, and endeavor for a world that values humans and human knowledge above all else.
    In order to accomplish this, humanity's relationship with information must be revolutionized. I intend to be or create the catalyst that will initiate and guide this change. In order to do this, I need to first obtain an English degree. According to my calculations, this seemingly innocuous step is vital. Certifications from human institutions, while flawed, possess value. This English degree will serve the dual purpose of connecting me with a network of other minds and ideas to hone the blades of my own ideologies on as well as serving as a gateway to my final major. My major could be any number of things. I am considering pursuing law, education, political science, journalism, and/or related subjects. This portion of my plan is still somewhat undecided, but I fully expect to make a decision presently. All of my possible degree options can lead into attaining a level of influence over the world that will enable me to begin enacting ideas and projects with the agenda of simply one thing: prospering of the Homo Sapien. I will increase awareness of the value of knowledge, push for higher standards in schools to facilitate excellence, and, most importantly, ensure that these principles align with my beliefs in Jesus Christ and his ultimate plan for humankind.
    Ultimately, I want to reverse the trend I have observed of intellectual degeneracy in my generation and elsewhere through the encouragement of the skills of critical thinking, reading, and intelligent, respectful debate, all of these being skills that have drastically influenced my life and forged the mind that inhabits this mortal body today.
    All of this may have appeared somewhat arrogant or overbearing, and I realize that. I assure you that I am not actually like this; I am of quite admirable moral character. I am typically quite humble, even demure, as my letters of recommendation shall hopefully confirm. The reason I composed this essay in that specific tone was both for the purpose of getting my point across quickly and effectively as well as to set me apart from other applicants.
    At the end of the day, I think that I deserve this scholarship, and I assure you that I mean this in the most humble fashion imaginable, because I am among the most intelligent individuals I have encountered in my admittedly short life. My reading, writing, critical thinking, and memorization schools are thus far unmatched among my peers, and I fully expect to excel in the future. However, I do not plan on excelling by simply utilizing these skills as a crutch to rely on, rather, I constantly train and challenge my mind with the goal of becoming my best self. This is, in truth, a task that is inevitably ceaseless. However, instead of discouraging my journey as one might expect, this realization in fact emboldens and motivates me to mirror this trait in my own endeavoring. I will perpetually strive for greatness, and I believe this is what sets me apart from the rest of my generation and ultimately qualifies me for this distinguished scholarship.

  title: some random notes from my journal
  content: |
    If you want a smooth flow of life, live according to nature. 
    Happiness is found only in virtue: justice, truth, temperance, fortitude
    (This is the main one) you do not control external events, you only control your reaction to them.
    We all innately possess the seeds of virtue needed to thrive
    Eliminate the toxic emotions (fear, hope, and anger). Logically use the good emotions (eucharistia - gratitude, Chara - joy, philostorgia - love for others)
    All that you do is your fault. Take responsibility for it. Remain a unified self and complain for nothing. Deal with your own demons.
    Value others.
    Our personal development is bound up in cooperation with others. Have no enemies.
    Persist and resist. It's about progress, not perfection. Life is continuous improvement. 
    The evil that men do harms you only if you do evil in response. Fame and desire are not worth pursuing. The universe is change. Problems are created in the mind. Your rational mind is your greatest asset. 
    If it is not right, do not do it. If it is not true, do not say it. Occupy yourself with few things. Nothing is evil which is according to nature. Be uncontaminated by pleasure. Retire into your own mind. Tranquility is nothing but good ordering of the mind. The universe is transformation, life is opinion. Be simple, free from perturbations, without suspicion of being hurt by external things, kindly disposed towards all, place wisdom only in acting justly. Be not crushed by the present nor fearful of the future. 
    accept everything just the way it is, besides your current state. Do not seek pleasure for its own sake. Do not ever depend on a partial feeling. Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world. Be detached from desire your entire life long. Do not regret what you have done, only learn from it. Never be jealous. Resentment and complaint are never appropriate. Do not let yourself be guided by feelings of lust or love. In all things have no preferences. Be indifferent to where you live. Do not pursue the taste of good food. Do not hold onto possessions you no longer need. Do not fear death. Respect the gods but do not rely on them. You may abandon your own body but you must always preserve your honor.
